    "The code, while functional, could use a few changes to become more robust and readable.  Firstly, variable names could be selected a bit more carefully to avoid confusion.  \"prime\" as a boolean and \"primes\" as a list of integers is a bit confusing; renaming the boolean to \"is_prime\" or an equivalent would make it more clear what kind of value is contained by the boolean.  The other main advise would be to add more checks for user inputs.  Currently, the program does not check user input to see if it will actually function in the context of the program.  For a user who does not know these bounds, it would be helpful to catch these errors and display custom error messages.  However, that is not to say the code is not functional or efficient.  The code implements the eratosthenes sieve, and finds a list of prime numbers.  Additionally, the code could use a few comments to explain what exactly each method does."

    "The code seems to work as intended. The code should be changed to conform to standards by adding block comments for all applicable regions in the appropriate areas. The code itself has been formatted correctly aside from this. Other comments have been added to improve readability and to attribute credit where it is due. Also, some variable names are a bit ambiguous as to their purpose and so should be revised or clarified in the block comment. I recommend that a block comment for the entire file is added and ensure that each defined function has a block comment for readability. "
